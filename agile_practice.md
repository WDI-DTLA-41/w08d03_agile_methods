# Human Knot-Teaches self-organization

**Lets get into groups of 6**

Players form a large circle, facing inside the circle. Everyone moves in 
close (shoulder-to-shoulder) and reaches their left hand into the mix, 
grabbing the left hand of another player (NOT your immediate neighbor). 
Next, reach in the right hands and grab a new person’s right hand 
(again, not the neighbor next to you).
While keeping all hands connected, proceed to twist and turn out of the 
scrambled knot they’ve formed. After a minute or more, the group should 
once again return to a large circle of people clasping hands.

**Remember: Safety first. If someone is getting squeezed or about to trip, 
it’s better to release a hand or two tham to end up with broken bones or 
sprained thingies.**
